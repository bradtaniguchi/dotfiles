# legacy scripts

These scripts were used on my older linux laptops. We can move away from them, as
I usually use a windows WSL environment, or cloud based environment.

The scripts in this folder generally don't work outside of specific linux environments
so I'm leaving them more for future reference, but they aren't used.
